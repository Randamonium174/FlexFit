        <h2>A Journey of Transformation</h2>
        <p>
            In 2022, I embarked on a transformative journey that changed my life forever. Alongside my friend Senthil Kumar, I joined a gym, motivated 
            but lacking the knowledge to make meaningful progress. For three months, I worked out every day, yet the results didn’t show. Weighing just 
            48 kg at the time, I faced teasing and bullying from my college friends. Their comments stung deeply, pushing me to make a change.
        </p>
        <p>
            Determined to turn things around, I switched to a new gym and started learning from my coach and gym peers. I also explored online resources, 
            diving into nutrition guides, training programs, and supplement advice. With structured workouts and a focused diet, I began seeing progress, 
            fueling my fire to stay dedicated. My friends started noticing, and their respect motivated me further. This marked the true beginning of my 
            fitness journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            By 2024, with unwavering support from my girlfriend, I prepared for my first bodybuilding competition. Through relentless dedication, I transformed 
            my physique from 76 kg to a competition-ready 60 kg. On September 22, 2024, I competed in the MR South India (Monster Classic), placing 6th. It 
            was the proudest moment of my life—a validation of the hard work, discipline, and resilience I had invested.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inspired by my success, I founded FlexFit to help others experience their own transformations. As a fitness trainer, my mission is to guide clients 
            toward achieving 100% transformations—whether it’s weight loss, muscle gain, or overall fitness improvements. FlexFit represents my commitment to 
            changing lives, just as my life was changed.
